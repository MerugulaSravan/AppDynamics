The AD Metric Browser can display metrics as a mash-up of data from cloud vendors.

For example, AD can analyze CloudWatch metrics of Amazon S3 service usage for buckets designated:

Size of all the objects present in bucket(s).

Objects Count of objects present in bucket(s) configured

Since Last Modified Time of objects in bucket(s) configured.

The code and configuration notes are at
https://github.com/Appdynamics/aws-s3-monitoring-extension

To install the agent in AWS to do the above:

Download file S3Monitor.zip

The jar file in it was compiled from https://github.com/Appdynamics/aws-s3-monitoring-extension and includes dependencies pulled in.

PROTIP: Some enterprises prefer to recompile and store it in their Artifactory repository for internal use rather than downloading
from the internet unreviewed by ethical hackers.

Unzip it into folder machineagent install dir/monitors/

The monitor.xml for AD points to the yml file. It’s in the config folder.

Open S3Configurations.yml in a text editor.

Copy and paste the *accesskey: for S3 account.

Copy and paste the *secretkey: for S3 account.

Copy and paste the * metricPrefix: Metric prefix path for AppDynamics controller.

onlyConsolidatedMetric: true or false(default).

If only consolidated metric is required (Bucket wise metrics will not be pushed to controller if this is true)

noOfThreads: Min-1, Max-32, Default-8

sizeunit: B, KB (Default), MB

timeunit: Seconds (Default), Minutes, Hours, Days

bucketNames: Bucket names to monitor.

To monitor all available buckets remove this field or Add a bucket named “All”.

To avoid permission issues, install the agent as the same user who owns the Machine Agent files or as an administrator on the host machine.

PROTIP: To detect any typos, use a YML validator such as http://www.yamllint.com, even when the file is generated.

Review the monitor.xml.

Restart the machineagent.
